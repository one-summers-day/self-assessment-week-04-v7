## Authentication
Explain why each system fails, and how to guard against that failure:
- Plaintext passwords
  If the system that stores the passwords is hacked, the hackers would have access to all of the passwords.
- Encrypted passwords
  Encrypted passwords can be decrypted which means that passwords could still be compromised if hackers were able to get a hold of/ figure out the encryption.
- Hashed passwords
  If hackers got a hold of enough data, they could make a rainbow table and figure out some associated hashes and passwords based on commonly used passwords.
